Hello, my name is Yushan He. I am developing a website dashboard which visualize unemployment data. Many people got unemployed because of the COVID-19 virus, so I think to visualize unemployment data will be helpful for people and giving an idea for unemployed people to planning the next step. We will be collecting unemployment data from different age, field and locations. Also collecting some information from the COVID-19, economic news and government action. These are some factor will affect the unemployment data, so that we will also adding these information inside the website. Also we will plot our dataset in different charts to maximum visualize the dataset. The problems I face in developing this website dashboard is getting the last information all around the country and relate the unemployment data to the social situation. To solve this problem, we will collect the last dataset and possibly research all social factor happened recently. By using this website dashboard, unemployed people can easily and faster get the last information from their field, instead going to many different websites.  It could be also supporting the government to control the unemployment ratio. Thank you for your interest in my unemployment visualization website dashboard.
